## 🌍 **Overview**

This project focuses on developing a **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)** agent capable of performing **soft landings** on both **stationary and moving barges**.  
The PPO algorithm was selected for its **stability, ease of implementation, and performance** in **continuous control environments**.  

The objective is to **minimize crash probability and fuel consumption** while maintaining a **smooth, upright, and precise touchdown** under dynamic conditions.

## 🌌 **Environment Description**

The custom environment simulates a 2D rocket controlled via thrust and torque.  
It provides continuous feedback about position, velocity, and contact status.

| Observation Index | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| 0 | Horizontal Position |
| 1 | Vertical Position |
| 2 | Horizontal Velocity |
| 3 | Vertical Velocity |
| 4 | Angle (radians) |
| 5 | Angular Velocity |
| 6 | Left Leg Contact (1/0) |
| 7 | Right Leg Contact (1/0) |

**Termination Conditions:**
- ✅ Landed successfully  
- 💥 Crashed or out of bounds  
- ⛽ Fuel exhausted

## 🎮 **Action & State Spaces**

| Action | Range | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Main Engine Throttle | [0.0, 1.0] | Controls vertical lift |
| Side Engine Thrust | [-1.0, 1.0] | Controls lateral movement |
| Nozzle Angle | [-1.0, 1.0] | Adjusts rocket orientation |

The **state space** is continuous (8-dimensional), allowing the policy to observe smooth dynamics of flight.

## 🧮 **Reward Function**

The reward function encourages **safe, stable, and fuel-efficient landings**.  

\[
R_t = \frac{(S_t - S_{t-1})}{10} - 0.3 \times (\text{main\_power} + \text{side\_power})
\]

**Terminal Rewards:**
- **+10** → Landed safely  
- **−10** → Crashed / Out of bounds  

**Penalties:**
- Upward velocity → −1  
- Fuel usage → proportional penalty  

This formulation uses a **potential-based shaping function** to stabilize learning and ensure smooth policy convergence.

## 🧠 **Neural Network Architecture**

| Network | Layers | Activation |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| Actor (Policy) | [256, 256] | ReLU |
| Critic (Value) | [256, 256] | ReLU |

**Input:** 8-dimensional state vector  
**Outputs:**  
- Actor → 3 continuous actions (thrust, side, rotation)  
- Critic → scalar value \(V(s)\)

</p>

The **Actor–Critic** structure ensures that the policy learns **continuous control commands** while maintaining **value-based stability**.

## ⚠️ **Challenges & Future Work**

**Challenges**
- High reward variance during early training → unstable convergence  
- Balancing fuel penalty vs. landing reward  
- Random initial states causing inconsistent learning  
- Long training times due to small learning rate  
- Occasional policy collapse when critic became over-confident  

**Future Work**
- Extend environment to **3D landing dynamics**  
- Add **wind and random turbulence** for robustness  
- Implement **domain randomization** for real-world transfer  
- Explore **multi-agent coordination** for multiple landers  
- Use **reward normalization** and **adaptive clipping** for stability
